# "Sharks from Space" Challenge Overview

## Summary
The ocean is one of the planet's most powerful habitats, sustaining essential ecosystems. The challenge asks teams to build a mathematical framework that identifies sharks and predicts their feeding habitats using NASA satellite data, and to design an intelligent tag that reports not only where sharks are, but also what they are eating, transmitting the data in near real time.

## Context
- Sharks are apex predators that regulate food webs and preserve diversity.
- Fishing pressure increases the urgency to understand where they feed and how they move.
- SWOT and PACE data let us track oceanic eddies and phytoplankton composition, both crucial to locating foraging hotspots.

## Primary Objectives
1. Develop a model (mathematical or machine learning) that links oceanographic variables with shark foraging behavior.
2. Propose an electronic tag concept capable of measuring position, feeding activity, and transmitting data almost in real time.

## Guiding Questions
- Which physical characteristics of the ocean (temperature, currents, eddies) influence shark feeding?
- How does biological productivity (phytoplankton) connect to predator movement patterns?
- When do sharks choose to stay near the surface or dive deeper?
- What ecological impacts can be inferred from shark locations?

## Possible Deliverables
- A simple model that ingests satellite data and generates hotspot maps.
- Visualizations (images, interactive maps, short videos) that explain relationships between sharks and environmental variables.
- A proposal for a new satellite observation or data fusion that helps identify critical habitats.

## Target Audience
- High-school students.
- The general public interested in marine conservation.

## Communication Recommendations
- Explain why sharks matter for ocean balance.
- Show how better predictions can support fisheries management, tourism, and conservation.
- Use accessible language, complemented by interactive visualizations or educational materials.
