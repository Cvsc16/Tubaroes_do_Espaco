# Pitch Outline - Sharks from Space (2-3 minutes)

1. **Real problem:** apex predators under pressure; we need to predict **where** and **when** they feed.
2. **Solution:** daily predictive map using **PACE (chlorophyll)** + **SWOT (eddies)** + **SST (MUR)** + **ECCO (currents)**.
3. **Science:** grounded in literature (Braun 2019; Gaube 2018).
4. **Product:** interactive heatmap plus validation with real tracks (OBIS/OCEARCH/tag data).
5. **Innovative tag:** moves from “where” to **“how/when”** (IMU + audio + gastric proxy) with telemetry.
6. **Impact:** conservation, sustainable fisheries, education.
7. **Next steps:** expand regions/species, quantify uncertainty, partner to build the tag prototype.
