# Project Resources

## Priority NASA Datasets
- **PACE (Plankton, Aerosols, Clouds and Ecosystems)** - global, high-resolution coverage of phytoplankton abundance and community composition.
- **MODIS Aqua (L3)** - long-term chlorophyll-a time series to monitor productivity trends.
- **SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography)** - high-resolution tracking of eddies and sea-surface height anomalies.
- **MUR SST (GHRSST)** - near-real time sea-surface temperature for detecting thermal fronts.
- **ECCO (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean)** - daily u/v velocity fields to understand nutrient transport.

## Supporting Scientific Literature
- **Braun et al. (2019)** - hot eddies allow pelagic sharks to forage in the twilight zone without thermal stress.
- **Gaube et al. (2018)** - links adult white shark movements in the Gulf Stream/Sargasso Sea to mesoscale structures.

## Partner Resources and Tutorials
- **Canadian Space Agency (CSA):**
  - *smartWhales: Using space to keep whales safe* - example of satellite data applied to megafauna protection.
  - *Monitoring and protecting our ecosystem from space* - overview of environmental monitoring via satellites.
- **SWOT Portal** - data access, documentation, and tutorials for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission.
- **SWOT mission materials** - institutional information from NASA, CNES, CSA, and UKSA describing mission scope (90% of Earth’s surface waters).

## How We Use These Resources
1. **Datasets** - feed our download (`01_search_download.py`) and preprocessing (`02_preprocess.py`) scripts.
2. **Articles** - provide scientific grounding for selected variables and storytelling.
3. **Institutional resources** - support communication about international collaboration and practical applications.
