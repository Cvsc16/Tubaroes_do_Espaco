# Research on FFT Technologies and Underwater Acoustic Monitoring

## Fourier Analysis (FFT) in Underwater Acoustics
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an efficient tool for analyzing frequency content. Underwater applications include acoustic communication, ranging, beamforming for 3D imaging, and target classification. For our challenge, FFT will decompose raw hydrophone data so we can spot acoustic patterns associated with shark feeding.

## Underwater Sound Pattern Recognition
Machine-learning methods (e.g., CNNs) have proven effective for classifying underwater sound sources. For the shark tag, we capture bite sounds or feeding-related noises, extract FFT-based features, and train a classifier to label events.

## Shark Bioacoustics and Feeding Sounds
Marine bioacoustics studies show that some sharks produce sounds and that bioacoustic probes can record their acoustic environment, including feeding events. An implanted recorder on *Carcharhinus melanopterus* captured reef fish vocalizations, boat noise, and **the shark’s feeding sound**, validating our premise.

## Initial Recommendations for the Tag
1. **High-sensitivity hydrophone:** optimized for the frequency range where feeding sounds occur.
2. **Onboard signal processing:** MCU with DSP capability to run FFT in real or near-real time and extract features.
3. **Pattern-recognition algorithms:** ML models (e.g., neural networks, SVM) to label events as feeding vs. non-feeding; requires a dedicated training dataset.
4. **Data transmission:** low-power, long-range communication (satellite or acoustic relays) to meet NASA’s real-time requirement.

This preliminary research confirms the technical feasibility of using FFT and hydrophones to detect shark feeding patterns and highlights the need to gather specialized audio and develop classification methods.
