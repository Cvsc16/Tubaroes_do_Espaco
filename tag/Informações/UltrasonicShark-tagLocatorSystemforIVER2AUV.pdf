heterodyne the signal as explained by Sonotronics technical support:
“The “first” NE602 heterodynes the incoming signal with a variable frequency “LO” (local
oscillator) to produce a 455kHz IF (when looking for a 75kHz input, LO is set to 380kHz to
produce a ‘sideband’ of 455kHz). The resultant signal is passed through the 455kHz filter,
and this output is heterodyned at the ‘second’ NE602 with a fixed 456kHz (aka beat
frequency oscillator) to produce a 1khz sideband... in this version of the receiver, the 1kHz
signal is used to indicate the presence of the desired initial signal (75kHz) and to produce an
audible note as well [8].”
Because oscillator schematics were not available, the oscillator circuits needed to be
designed. Many different resistor/capacitor/op amp configurations were experimented with
to construct a suitable oscillator but none could produce a clean signal higher than 240 kHz.
4.2 Second Approach: Custom Design Circuit
The Sonotronics filter was designed to produce an audible tone for the operator to listen
for. However, the project did not require the signal to be converted to a certain frequency
but rather to accurately detect the pulse received from each hydrophone. With this in mind,
a new filter was designed in LabVIEW that used an adjustable 73 kHz band-pass filter rather
than using the 455 kHz mechanical filter. A preamplifier circuit was chosen to boost the gain
